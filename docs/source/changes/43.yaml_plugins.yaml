summary: "YAML configuration files support plugins via ``!MyPlugin`` tags"
description: |
  Plugins can be registered for use in YAML configuration files.
  Packages register plugins via the ``cobald.config.yaml_constructors`` entry
  point; plugins can then be used with YAML tags such as ``!MyPlugin``.
  The ``cobald`` package provides its Controllers and Decorators as YAML plugins.
