summary: "fallback for fitness of WeightedComposite depends on supply"
description: |
  Computing the fitness of :py:class:`~cobald.composite.weighted.WeightedComposite`
  is undefined whenever its ``weight`` is zero. The fallback previously unconditionally
  asserted perfect fitness -- this is not appropriate for the new weights added in #67.
  With this change, perfect fitness is only assumed when the supply is zero, meaning
  that fitness is truly unknown. In any other case, the actual fitness is used.
